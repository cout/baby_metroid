Baby Metroid
============

Baby Metroid is a new romhack for Super Metroid.  It is currently under
development.

Goals:
* Easy enough that a three- or four-year-old can play and have fun
* New puzzles and bosses to entertain adults
* Python-based tools to make modifying the game as simple as making
  ascii art
