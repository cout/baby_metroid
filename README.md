Baby Metroid
============

Baby Metroid is a new romhack for Super Metroid targeted at younger
players.  I wrote it for my son, who badly wanted to play but lacked the
experience to complete the full game on his own.

Story: The death of the Baby Metroid weighing on her conscience, Samus
Aran purchases a quantum time engine and uses it to travel back in time,
intending to defeat not only Mother Brain but also destiny itself.

The game is intended for children, but I have included some puzzles to
hopefully make the game interesting for adults too.
