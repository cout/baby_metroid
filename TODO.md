TODO
====

Top priority:
* Spore spawn music needs to work again
* Figure out what to do for Kraid
* Speed hallway - it is too easy to get stuck under the crumbles

Later:
* Bubble mountain - will E ride the wavers or find the tunnel?
* The spikes in double chamber are difficult
* That should be how Samus gets up red tower (replace blocks at the top
    with speed blocks)
* Ice beam is broken (it no longer freezes enemies)

Bugs:
* Samus loses easy blue suit after a wall jump while pressing run, and 
  there is no windup sound when using easy blue suit after that

Ideas:
* Replace space pirates with etecoons
* Replace climb pirates with dachora (ride the dachora up!) - decided to
    add an elevator instead
* Croc really does take a bath
* Get rid of "nothing" drops
* E does not like the mosquitoes - replace them with something else?

* easier wall jumps - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=545
* climb room elevator - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=445
* flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=73
* older flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=39
* for kraid, perhaps put mini-kraid into his room instead (and require
  some trick to get out of the room)
* is there a more intuitive way through green pirates room?
* Perhaps power bombs (w/ ice beam) should freeze enemies (so they
  become "freeze bombs").  If so then Ridley could be defeated with a
  single power bomb (which would cause him to spit ice or snow balls
  instead of fireballs).
* Keep blue suit in lava?

Tooling ideas:
* Script to generate room list in asm format
* Extract room script should write out room header(s) as a comment
* Write out size as a word instead of as bytes
