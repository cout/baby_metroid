TODO

Top priority:
* Spore spawn music needs to work again
* Hint light in Climb
* Script to generate room list in asm format
* Extract room script should write out room header(s) as a comment
* Write out size as a word instead of as bytes

Then:
* I don't know what to about Below Spazer
* Getting to Kraid difficult - how do you know to try to bomb the
    blocks? (maybe an exploding etecoon?)
* Figure out Kraid

Later:
* Speed hallway is a challenge - the crumbles are hard
* The spikes in double chamber are difficult
* Holding the run button should charge up a shine spark without running
* That should be how Samus gets up red tower (replace blocks at the top
    with speed blocks)

Ideas:
* The riding enemies logic does not work if Samus is moving up.  Need to
    revisit the kamer logic to see what it does in this case.
* Samus should fall in noob bridge (change one of the 1x1 crumbles to a
    2x1 and make the following block a horizontal extension)
* Replace space pirates with etecoons
* Replace climb pirates with dachora (ride the dachora up!) - decided to
    add an elevator instead
* Croc really does take a bath
* Get rid of "nothing" drops
* Elliott does not like the mosquitoes - replace them with something
  else
* apple sporespawn - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=2
* easier wall jumps - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=545
* climb room elevator - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=445
* flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=73
* older flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=39
* prevent early supers (use power bomb blocks)
* for kraid, perhaps put mini-kraid into his room instead (and require
  some trick to get out of the room)
* is there a more intuitive way through green pirates room?
