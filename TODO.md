Top priority:
* Spore spawn music needs to work again
* Hint light in Climb
  * Idea: instead of lights that come on, can I have a "ghost Samus"?
    This would also work for other rooms such as the entrance to Kraid's
    lair.

Then:
* Getting to Kraid's area is difficult - how do you know to try to bomb
  the blocks? (maybe an exploding etecoon?)
* Figure out what to do for Kraid

Later:
* Rising tide - easy to get stuck in the lava/acid
* Bubble mountain - will E ride the wavers or find the tunnel?
* Speed hallway is a challenge - the crumbles are hard
* The spikes in double chamber are difficult
* Holding the run button should charge up a shine spark without running
* That should be how Samus gets up red tower (replace blocks at the top
    with speed blocks)
* Ice beam is broken (it no longer freezes enemies)

Ideas:
* Replace space pirates with etecoons
* Replace climb pirates with dachora (ride the dachora up!) - decided to
    add an elevator instead
* Croc really does take a bath
* Get rid of "nothing" drops
* E does not like the mosquitoes - replace them with something else?

* easier wall jumps - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=545
* climb room elevator - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=445
* flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=73
* older flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=39
* for kraid, perhaps put mini-kraid into his room instead (and require
  some trick to get out of the room)
* is there a more intuitive way through green pirates room?
* Perhaps power bombs (w/ ice beam) should freeze enemies (so they
  become "freeze bombs").  If so then Ridley could be defeated with a
  single power bomb (which would cause him to spit ice or snow balls
  instead of fireballs).

Tooling ideas:
* Script to generate room list in asm format
* Extract room script should write out room header(s) as a comment
* Write out size as a word instead of as bytes
