Ideas:
* If an enemy is moving under Samus and touching Samus, make Samus move
  with the enemy (like Rippers)
* Replace space pirates with etecoons
* Replace climb pirates with dachora (ride the dachor up!)
* Croc really does take a bath
* Get rid of "nothing" drops
* Elliott does not like the mosquitoes - replace them with something
  else
* apple sporespawn - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=2
* easier wall jumps - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=545
* climb room elevator - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=445
* flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=73
* older flying ship - https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=39
* prevent early supers (use power bomb blocks)
* for kraid, perhaps put mini-kraid into his room instead (and require
  some trick to get out of the room)
* is there a more intuitive way through green pirates room?
